# pdm_project

University Project. Application is not fully done, it has also some harcoded data just because I decided to make sure all the parts that i want o integrate are working well together. I think this is a good starting point for what can I do next with it.

## Getting Started

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
